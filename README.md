# Diabetes Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether an individual has diabetes based on certain medical attributes. This is done using various machine learning algorithms.

## Contents

- `Diabetes Prediction-checkpoint.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `models/`: Directory where trained models are saved.
- `results/`: Directory for storing results and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). It includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 or 1 indicating the presence or absence of diabetes)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:



Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Copy
cd diabetes-prediction
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Copy
jupyter notebook
Open the Diabetes Prediction-checkpoint.ipynb notebook and run the cells to execute the code.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Training
The notebook covers the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Training various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Making predictions on new data using the trained model.
Results
The results of the model training and evaluation are stored in the results/ directory. This includes performance metrics and visualizations.
